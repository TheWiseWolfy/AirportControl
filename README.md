Airport Control is a simple Java application that acts as an editor for a database with information related to the aviation industry. The application allows you to display, insert, remove and edit different tables. The application interacts with the remote database using OracleSQL through JDBC. Also, the interface is realized using JavaFX and CSS.  User experience has been one of the main priorities of this project, as well as understanding more about relational databases.
